# Android Project 5 - *Bit FIt*

Submitted by: **Mike Odnis**

**Bit Fit** is a health metrics app that allows users to track their daily calorie count and view their progress over time. The app allows users to create new entries for each day, and view their past entries in a RecyclerView. The app also saves the user's entries in a database, so that they are preserved even after the app is restarted.
